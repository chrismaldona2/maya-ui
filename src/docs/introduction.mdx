Welcome to Maya UI — a collection of free open-source animated UI components designed for you to use in your next web project.

This isn't a traditional design system with rigid rules, but rather a creative playground showcasing unique interactions and modern styling approaches.

Inspired by <UIVerseLink/>, Maya offers a variety of dynamic components that prioritize both aesthetics and functionality. It’s a perfect resource for experimenting with animations and building visually engaging websites.
