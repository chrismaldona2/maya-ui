    ## Key considerations

    Providing a solid and flexible foundation, every component is crafted using TypeScript to ensure robustness and maintainability. If you’re working with JavaScript, simply remove the type annotations, and the components will work seamlessly.

    Additionally, some components include Next.js directives (e.g., <code>'use client'</code>) to optimize server and client rendering. For vanilla React projects, these directives can be safely removed without affecting functionality.
