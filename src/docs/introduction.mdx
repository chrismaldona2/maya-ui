    ## Key considerations

    Every component is crafted using TypeScript to provide a solid and flexible foundation. If you're working with JavaScript, simply remove the type annotations and the components will work seamlessly.

    Some components include Next.js directives (like <code>'use client'</code>) to optimize server and client rendering. For vanilla React projects, these directives can be safely removed without affecting functionality.

    <ins>Performance</ins> is essential. Whenever possible, animations are created using only CSS to ensure optimal speed and efficiency.

    Inspired by <UIVerseLink/>, Maya UI’s about mixing good looks with solid use, plus a bit of learning along the way. Take components as they are or customize them to your needs — all code is designed to be explored and modified.
