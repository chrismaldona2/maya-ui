    ## Animation dependencies
    Some components require animation libraries to achieve complex interactions and motion effects.
</header>

- [**Motion**](https://motion.dev/) - A powerful animation library for React.

    ## Basic installation
    To use these dependencies in your project, install them using npm or yarn:
</header>

<ContainerWithTabs
    tabs={[
        {
            label: "npm",
            content: <CodeSnippet code={`//core
npm install tailwind-merge clsx

//animation
npm install motion

//3d
npm install three @types/three @react-three/fiber`} language="javascript" disableCopy/>,
        },

        {
            label: "yarn",
            content: <CodeSnippet code={`//core
yarn add tailwind-merge clsx

//animation
yarn add motion

//3d
yarn add three @types/three @react-three/fiber`} language="javascript" disableCopy/>
        }

]}/>

<Note>Tailwind CSS installation may require multiple steps. For detailed instructions, visit their [installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/).</Note>

Each component will specify which libraries are required.
